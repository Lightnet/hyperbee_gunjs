# Information:
  Prototype hyerbee and gun.js server.

  Note need more better handle array. Just sample test.

  To test how get and put for gun to set and get from hyerbee.

  Idea by using the peer to peer network from npm "pear". https://docs.pears.com
```
Pear loads applications remotely from peers and allows anyone to create and share applications with peers.
```
 One of the reason is without need certs. Just base on peer to peer network. Is what I think. Since it secure network and keys from pear packages.
