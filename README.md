  Just sample test.

  Prototype build for peer to peer network on nodejs npm pear package (https://docs.pears.com). To develop on hyperbee as database and gun.js graph node tree. Since gun.js can be use as server and client to handle app.

  Idea by using the peer to peer secure network.
```
Pear loads applications remotely from peers and allows anyone to create and share applications with peers.
```
 One of the reason is without need certs on web site hosting. Just used on peer to peer network. Is what I think. Since it secure network and keys from pear packages.

 Note need more better handle array.

# Install:
```
  npm install -g pear
```
  Current windows does not work currently.

# Start:

Command line
```
npm install
node webserver.js
```
  Just testing how gun handle get and put into the hyperbee database.
